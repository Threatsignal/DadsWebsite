            <p>My name is Al Schellenberg. I have been living in Mississauga for the past 3 years. I moved here shortly after
                retiring from my previous job as a manager at Safeway for 40 years. I have always worked long hours and have found joy in the work that I do. However, I 
                found after retiring that I had too much free time on my hands â€” I needed a hobby. </p>
            <p>After making new some new friends out here and helping them with some odd jobs, I discovered a new passion. I
                began tackling large projects, doing side work for my friends. Eventually, my work spread through word of mouth. I have had continuous work with my new found hobby for 2 years.</p>
            <p>As I continue doing what I love, I have gained an incredible amount of experience and I wish to further hone my skills. If you are interested in hiring me as a contractor please don't
                hesitate to call me anytime for an estimate! </p>
